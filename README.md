# Student Portfolio Application

This project is a React-based student portfolio application built using Vite. It demonstrates a clean and minimal project structure while following modern React development practices. The application serves as a foundation for showcasing personal information, projects, and skills.

---

## Project Structure Overview

The core functionality of the application is handled through the following files:

---

## index.html

The `index.html` file is the main HTML entry point of the application.

### Responsibilities
- Defines the base HTML structure
- Contains the root DOM element (`<div id="root"></div>`) where the React application is mounted
- Loads the JavaScript module that initializes the React application

This file does not contain application logic but provides the container required for React rendering.

---

## main.jsx

The `main.jsx` file is the primary JavaScript entry point for the React application.

### Responsibilities
- Imports React and ReactDOM
- Imports global styles from `style.css`
- Renders the root `App` component using `ReactDOM.createRoot`

This file connects the static HTML file to the React component tree.

---

## App.jsx

The `App.jsx` file defines the main React component of the application.

### Responsibilities
- Serves as the root component of the user interface
- Defines the layout and structure of the portfolio
- Manages component composition and content rendering

---

## style.css

The `style.css` file contains the global styling rules for the application.

### Responsibilities
- Defines layout, typography, and color styles
- Ensures consistent styling across components
- Separates presentation from application logic

---

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS

## Result

After this fix:
- ✅ Headings will render correctly
- ✅ Sections will be clearly separated
- ✅ Code will be properly formatted
- ✅ GitHub preview will look professional and readable

If you want, I can also:
- Align this with **university marking criteria**
- Add a **deployment section (GitHub Pages / Netlify)**
- Make it **ATS / recruiter-friendly**

Just tell me 👍
